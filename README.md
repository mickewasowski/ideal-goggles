# Navigation Project
This project is brought to you by me :)
The designs for the five subprojects, Github search, Equalizer, Tips Calculator, Loopstudio and E-commerce, are provided by the N2J Academy. My task was to create a pixel perfect and responsive pages.

Hosted at: https://rosen-projects.vercel.app/

## Start the project
```bash
yarn run dev
```

## Table of contents
1. On the home screen you will be presented with a menu of five cards, each corresponding to a navigational button to the relevant project.
2. When you navigate to a chosen project, at the very top of it you will be presented with an additional navigation bar, which lets you know the name of the project and also contains a back button, leading you back to the home screen.
